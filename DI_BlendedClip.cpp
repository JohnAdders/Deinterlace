// Blended Clipping Deinterlace - Tom Barry 11/09/2000
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// As written, Blended Clipping Deinterlace method is really designed as a testing
// laboratory.  It uses a huge confusing control panel and it has way too many
// controls to be user friendly as a final product.  It does, however, allow
// us to easily experiment with what might work best.  It may be able to provide an 
// example of some of the things that might be possible if we find a few sets of 
// parms that work well for various situations.  It can create both some decent results
// and also some very bad results depending upon both the input video and the
// parameter settings.

// Note that while I've attempted to optimize the assembler code, this method still
// eats a fair amount of CPU time.  In order to run it on my 350 or 450 mhz machines
// I must have all the dTV performance options turned on.

// How it works:

// Deinterlace algorithms face a choice between using the most recently received
// information which is accurate in time and using older field information which
// may be more accurate in space.  Adaptive algorithms make this choice on the fly
// for each field and/or pixel. Blended algorithms try to smoothly blend two or more  
// choices together, avoiding rapidly blinking pixels and some other artifacts. The
// Blended Clipping algorithm attempts to do all of the above.
//
// Assume we are processing an odd field.  Like most other simpler deinterlacing 
// methods, the Blended Clipping method will just use the current field info unchanged
// for the odd lines.  Odd lines are just copied to the video buffer for now though
// this too might be improved in the future.
//
// For the even lines we will create a blend of the Weave pixels (the previous even lines)
// and a Clipped Weave, which is itself a blend.
//
// The Clipped Weave is just the weave pixel unless it's luma (and optionally chroma) is
// outside the high/low range of its vertically adjacent pixels.  If so, the luma (chroma)
// values are clipped to the nearest adjacent value.  This is intended to be a 
// replacement for the various Interpolated BOB implementatons that usually represent
// the current time estimated value for the even lines.  To see the pure value of a
// Clipped Weave, without any other blending, just max out the "Minimum Clip" slider
// on the contol panel.  It still creates some BOB-like artifacts but they are less
// visible and don't seem to have the rapid up/down jitter of BOB implementations.

// Exactly what percentage of the Weave vs. Clipped Weave we use depends upon a number
// number of factors, each controlled by a slider in the Blended Clipping control panel.
// There are also INI parms for these values.  (currentlly 9 sliders, 2 check boxes)

// Most of the parameters should be thought of as unitless fuzzy preference values
// in the range of 0..100. The INI file parm names will be in the [deinterace] section
// will be the same as the global definitions.

// The slider names and descriptions follow.  The INI file/global names follow 
// each description:

// "Minimum Clip" slider: This can be uses to increase the amount of Clip vs Weave
// in the event that none of the other more specific values seem to work and you
// still see too many Weave artifacts ("venetion blinds").  It's best to try everything
// else first.

    int     BlcMinimumClip = -15;               // currently -100 .. 100

// "Pixel Motion Sensitivity" slider:  This determines how sensitive we are to motion.
// Motion is calculated as the maximum absolute change in luma from the previous field
// in either of the two vertically adjacent pixels.  I was going to use the change in 
// luma of the Weave pixel but that is not current enough to prevent the "flash attacks"
// of venetiaon blinds that can occur with sudden scene changes.  This value is
// calculated separately for each pixel.

    UINT    BlcPixelMotionSense = 17;

// "Recent Motion Sensitivity" slider:  This increases the tendency to use Clip based
// upon an n-period Exponential Moving Average of the recent motion.  Recent motion
// is in turn an arithmetic average of how much each pixel's luma has changed from the
// previous field.  These values are self obtained and maintained.  While this method
// does not attempt to do 3:2 pulldown I believe the motion values could be of assistance
// in the routines that do.  

    int     BlcRecentMotionSense = 0;       // current -100 .. 100)     

// "Motion Average Period" slider:  This sets the period of the moving average for Recent
// Motion Sensitivity.  

// For those of you not recently programming for the stock market:

//      An Exponential Moving Average is a way to keep and update an average without 
//      keeping around a history of all the recent events.  In the stock market,
//      an n Period Exponential Moving Average of variable X is usually defined as:

//          X_new_avg = ( X_old_avg * (n-1) + 2 * X) / (n+1)

    UINT    BlcMotionAvgPeriod = 20;        // currently 1..200

// "Pixel Comb Sensitivity" slider:  This determines how sensitive we are to the current
// comb factor of each pixel.  I used a simplified comb factor C = abs(2*W - H - L)/2,
// which is just the distance of the Weave pixel's luma from its interpolated value.
// This value is calculated separately for each pixel.  This value along with the Pixel
// Motion Sense seem to be the two main things to play with to get good results.  Generally,
// increase one of these if you get Weave artifacts and decrease one if you get BOB artifacts.
  
    UINT    BlcPixelCombSense = 27;

// "Recent Comb Senseitivity" slider:  Operates like the Recent Motion slider but operates
// on the average Comb Factor.

    UINT    BlcRecentCombSense = 0;

// "Comb Average Period" slider: Sets the period of the Comb exponential moving average.
// See the comments on "Motion Average Period".

    UINT    BlcCombAvgPeriod = 20;          // currently 1.200

// "Skip High Comb Frames" slider:  I added this one in the hopes that it could help to
// skip a frame in the event of a sudden flash attack on a rapid scene change or maybe
// help to handle some very poorly mastered anime using ?:? pulldown.  I have not had
// a chance to experiment with it yet.  It will give very ugly results if you set it 
// too high.

    UINT    BlcHighCombSkip = 10;           // larger values skip more

// "Skip Low Motion Frames" slider:  This also is just experimental an probably of low
// value.  The idea here is that any frame with sufficiently low change from the previous
// one is maybe a still frame with some video noise, and could be skipped.  Not for
// normal use.  NOTE - This slider (but not parm) will soon be replaced by the
// Vertical Smoothing slider.

    UINT    BlcLowMotionSkip = 0;           // larger values skip more

// "Vertical Smoothing" slider: Sets a smoothing constant to smooth between the even
// and odd lines.  Not yet implemented, but the INI parm is there.

    UINT    BlcVerticalSmoothing = 0;

// "Use Interpolated BOB instead of Clip" check box.  For those who don't like the
// Clipped Weave, this will change it to an Interpolated Bob.  All other blending and
// processing will still function. (but it probably won't look as good).

    BOOL    BlcUseInterpBob = FALSE;

// "Blend Chroma Value" check box:  Usually the chroma value for the Clipped Weave is
// just taken from the pixel above it.  Checking this box causes the chroma values to 
// also use the clip algoritm.

// Checking this box seems to get richer color detail and a more theater like picture
// but it sometimes seems to create some softness or shimmering on my stock ticker or
// rapidly moving objects with lots of detail like a hockey game.

    BOOL    BlcBlendChroma = TRUE;          // default should maybe be TRUE?

// Finally there is an INI parm, but not a contol to determine whether to even display
// the Blended Clipping controls when that method is selected. If set to false then
// Blended Clipping parms are determined only from the INI file.
