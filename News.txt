	Poor framework to support DScaler plug-ins (namely, DI_GreedyH.dll),
	support for VIDEOINFOHEADER2 and interlaced samples,
	correct field output - generate 2 deinterlaced frames for each
	incoming interlaced frame.

	The first version!
	It doesn't really do anything yet but I does show how 
	you would go about writing a deinterlacing plug-in.
