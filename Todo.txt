 TODO:
   
   * Build a player app that includes the filter

   * Find out what formats are required to support the majority of suitable capture cards

   * Optimize

   * Think about Mark Rejhon's 3/2 pulldown filter as well

   * Support free compliers not just MSVC

   * Add support for DScaler Filters as well

   * Rewrite media type negotiation to use upstream filter's enumerator
     Pass all media type changes from a downstream filter upstream and
     perform deinterlacing only on known media types - otherwise
     copy samples unmodified 

   * Update code to match project coding standards

   * Implement handling of field samples

   * Need algorithm options panel?
